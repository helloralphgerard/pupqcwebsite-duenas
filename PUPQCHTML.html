        <h1>PUP QUEZON CITY</h1>
        <p> The PUP Quezon City Campus is a monument of tangible success towards the struggle in people's fight against ignorance. 
            It began as petitions to have a higher educational institution for the youth at the National Government Center area from community organizations 
            and church groups and negotiations with local officials and other government agencies. "To establish a branch or an extension of PUP at the National Government Center with a mandate to 
            bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban poor communities of Quezon City, with priority given to those from the NGCHP," is the stated purpose as stated in the Deed of Assignment, 
            which was signed on March 24, 1997. PUP Quezon City has been producing top-notch, internationally competitive graduates in the fields of education, information technology, management, marketing, entrepreneurship, 
            and office management technology since its founding in 1997. </p>
        <p>
            PUP Quezon City Campus, formerly known as PUP Commonwealth Campus, is a 1.9-hectare forested land area that was assigned, transferred, and endorsed to the Polytechnic University of the Philippines as ASSIGNEE by the Home Insurance and Guaranty Corporation (HIGC) as Assignor, 
            a government-owned and controlled corporation created under RA 580 and currently located at Don Fabian Street, Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City. HUDCC-NGCHC is a government entity established by Executive Order No. 90 and with expanded functions under RA 7279. A Deed of Assignment was completed 
            and signed by the Attorney thanks to the combined efforts of Mr. Jaime E. Varela, Project Administrator, NGCHP, and Dr. Ofelia M. Carague, Executive Vice President of PUP. On March 24, 1997, MR. Wilfredo F. Hernandez, President of HIGC, DR. Zenaida A. Olonan, President of the University, and Dionisio C. Dela Serna, 
            Chairman of the HUDCC-NGCHC met with the sole goal of "establishing a branch or an extension of PUP at the National Government Center with a mandate to bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban poor communities of Quezon City, with priority given to those from the NGCHP." </p>
        <p>
            Before this, a Deed of Donation was executed between the Sentro sa Ikauunlad ng Kasanayan at Hanapbuhay (SIKHAY), an association duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), represented by its President, Rev. Fr., and PUP for the latter organization. The two halls, Rothlehner 
            and Misereor Building today, were donated to PUP for its purposes. Tabora, Joel E. S.J. PUP on February 26, 1997. </p>
        <p>
            PUP Quezon City began officially operating in the academic year 1998–1999, after opening in 1997 and offering a Master's in Educational Management under the Open University System. In addition, the school offered a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and a 1-Year Certificate in Information Communication Technology during its first year of formal operations. The two original buildings, known as Rothlehner and Misereor Halls, were part of the given property and have since been an essential feature of the campus, housing academic and 
            administrative offices for staff and students as well as classrooms and a Learning Resource Center.</p>
        <p>
            PUP President Dr. Zenaida A. Olonan presented Mr. Rothlehner with a Plaque of Recognition on July 29, 1997, at PUP Quezon City's official launch, which took place on the same premises. Other distinguished guests from the Quezon City Local Government and PUP administration also attended the event.
